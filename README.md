# Hi, I'm Karsten

Identity & security engineer based in Bellevue, WA.

I build tools at the intersection of authentication, developer experience, and AI-assisted development.

## What I'm Working On

- **[identity-lab](https://github.com/kphutt/identity-lab)** — Interactive CLI simulations for learning the modern identity stack (WebAuthn, OIDC, OAuth2, DPoP, SCIM, CAEP)
- **[interview-prep](https://github.com/kphutt/interview-prep)** — AI-powered interview prep pipeline generating deep-dive episodes, podcasts, and coaching bots
- **[ai-toolkit](https://github.com/kphutt/ai-toolkit)** — Skills, hooks, and MCP servers for extending Claude Code
- **[text-adventure-v2](https://github.com/kphutt/text-adventure-v2)** — Procedurally generated text adventure in Go with guaranteed-solvable dungeons

## Focus Areas

- Identity & access management (OAuth2, OIDC, WebAuthn, FAPI, SCIM)
- AI-assisted developer tooling
- Security engineering
