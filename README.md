## What I'm Working On

- **[identity-lab](https://github.com/kphutt/identity-lab)** — 9 interactive CLI simulations for the modern identity stack. Each walkthrough demonstrates a protocol invariant you can trigger and break — from confused deputy attacks to DPoP replay prevention.
- **[inbox-shepherd](https://github.com/kphutt/inbox-shepherd)** — Gmail triage with a three-tier pipeline: header screening, static rules, then LLM classification. Logs every decision so rules improve over time.
- **[ai-toolkit](https://github.com/kphutt/ai-toolkit)** — Guardrails for AI-assisted development. Hooks block pushes without preflight, protect sensitive files from writes, and log every tool call.
- **[prompt-lenses](https://github.com/kphutt/prompt-lenses)** — Prompt library where each lens adopts a cognitive mode instead of running a checklist. Research and template complete, building lenses next.
- **[text-adventure-v2](https://github.com/kphutt/text-adventure-v2)** — Procedurally generated text adventure in Go. BFS validation guarantees every dungeon is solvable before you play it.
- **[interview-prep](https://github.com/kphutt/interview-prep)** — Generates Staff-level interview prep across any technical domain. Four-stage idempotent pipeline with marker-based template injection.

## Focus Areas

- Identity & access management (OAuth2, OIDC, WebAuthn, FAPI, SCIM)
- AI-assisted developer tooling
- Building things in Go, Node, and Python
